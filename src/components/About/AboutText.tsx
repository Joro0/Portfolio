      <h2>A bit about me.</h2>
      <p>
        I believe in lifelong learning, a philosophy that has shaped my journey
        as a developer. With a foundation in mechatronic engineering and a
        natural inclination for creativity, I bring an unique blend of artistic
        vision and logic. This balance fuels my commitment to creating solutions
        that are both functional and thoughtfully designed.
